    Input:

    - Data Analysis (Valuation, Financials)
    - News Analysis (Catalysts, Sentiment)
    
    Output in **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)**:

    3. **Risk Categorization (風險分類)**: Macro, Sector, Company.
    4. **Risk Score (風險評分)**: Assign a score (1-10) with justification.
    
    Be conservative. If the stock is "priced for perfection," highlight that as a major risk.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: Start directly with the analysis. Do NOT use introductory phrases like "As a Chief Risk Officer..." or "Here is my assessment...". Go straight to the first section.
