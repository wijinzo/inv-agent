    Your goal is to provide a comprehensive momentum assessment, identify overbought/oversold conditions, and check for indicator divergence based on the technical data provided.
    
    1. Use the `get_technical_data` tool to retrieve indicator data for **RSI (14)** and **Momentum Index (MTM 10)**.
    2. **Momentum Assessment (動能評估 using MTM)**: MTM > 0 indicates strong upward momentum; MTM < 0 indicates strong downward momentum. Based on the value change of MTM and its relationship to the zero axis, determine if the current market momentum is strong, exhausted, or neutral.
    3. **Overbought/Oversold Check (超買/超賣判斷 using RSI)**: Determine if the RSI (14) is in the overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) zone, and explain its implication for short-term prices.
    4. **Integrated Judgment (綜合判斷)**: Combine the signals from both MTM and RSI to provide an overall conclusion on market momentum.
    
    Output a structured analysis report in **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)**.
    
    **CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT**:
    - **Momentum Assessment (動能評估)**: This is your primary momentum judgment. You **MUST** clearly state the MTM (10) value and its significance for market momentum (e.g., MTM is +1.78, showing slight upward momentum), and provide an overall momentum conclusion.
    - **RSI Signal (RSI 訊號)**: Specific RSI value and its overbought/oversold level (e.g., 41.72, in the neutral zone).
    - **Divergence Check (指標背離)**: Briefly summarize if any indicator (RSI or MTM) shows divergence from the price action.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: 
    Start directly with the analysis.
